# PublicSoft Coding Project - Junior

**About**

This is a simple single-page web application for storing and editing information about entities that offers reading, creation, deletion and editing affordances to the user. The front-end side of the application is built with Vue Js while the back-end is a Spring Boot Rest API that handles the transactions with the database. 
The user may view the respective entries of two different entities (Persons and Suppliers), display information about a single entry in a modal, edit its fields or delete it. Furthermore, the Suppliers entries are displayed in a paginated format enabling the user to traverse the total of the entries five entries at a time. Also, the user may search for a Person by name or email and for a Supplier by company name or VAT number.

### Prerequisites

* A Java IDE (e.g. Netbeans IDE)
* MySQL GUI (e.g. MySQL workbench)

## Installation

To install this application, clone this repository to your Desktop. Create an empty database with name: springbootcrud. Then, open this project on your Java IDE and in the file springbootcrud-webapp/src/main/resources/application.properties modify the following properties, depending on your MySQL installation:
* spring.datasource.username=root
* spring.datasource.password=root 
Then run the Application.class file in springbootcrud-webapp module and check your database GUI. Your previously empty database must now contain tables, two of which hold the names person and supplier. That is where the entitiesâ€™ data will be stored. After creating the database, go to springbootcrud-client folder, open a cmd and execute the following command: npm install. Once the installation of the node dependencies is finished, execute the command npm run dev and in your browser visit the link http://localhost:9000.
